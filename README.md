# League Ranking CLI App

## What This Does
This is a simple command-line app that takes football match results and creates a ranking table based on points:
- Win = 3 points
- Draw = 1 point
- Loss = 0 points

Teams with more points are ranked higher. If teams have the same points, they are sorted alphabetically.
